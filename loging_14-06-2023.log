A safer world where goods never stop moving.The Aurora DriverThe core of our technology is the Aurora Driver, our continuously improving, intelligent autonomous driving system, designed to see, understand, and safely traverse the world around it.Perception designed for highway drivingA fusion of different sensor types ensures the Aurora Driver leverages the best of all worlds, seeing at wide ranges, even in poor weather conditions. At the heart of this perception technology is our FirstLight Lidar, which extends our visibility to 400M down the road. Seeing at this distance allows for quicker reaction time and safer motion planning.
Doing what computers do bestThe Aurora Driver runs on a robust, proprietary computer that enables powerful software, able to understand complex environments and control the vehicle through them. It incorporates high definition mapping data, giving it deep familiarity with the ever-changing, surrounding world.Getting smarter every dayThe Aurora Driver has been trained on public roads and in virtual tests that expose it to rare scenarios. New events are captured and added to our simulation database, where they’re used to continually improve the system. Similarly, when the Aurora Driver encounters changes in the environment, they are shared with all other Aurora-powered vehicles.PausePlay% buffered00:00 Working with leaders across transportationWe are proud to work with leading automakers, suppliers, networks, carriers, and private fleets to put self-driving trucks and cars on the road. Our ecosystem of pilot customers, partners, and collaborators continues to grow.
Vehicle manufacturersAutonomy adoption starts with having the right OEM partners, allowing us to jointly develop reliable vehicle platforms that allow for deep Aurora Driver integration and manufacturing at scale.Logistics companiesWe’re defining the future of logistics operations with our customers by operating the Aurora Driver in real-world, commercially-representative pilots, moving goods in their networks. These pilots allow us to adapt Aurora Horizon to the needs of their business and allow our customers to prepare their business to realize the full potential of Aurora-powered trucks.Developing safely with Volvo Autonomous SolutionsVolvo Autonomous Solutions and Aurora, industry leaders in safety and autonomous technology, are partnered to deliver a safe and efficient autonomous transport solution with the Aurora Driver and Volvo's autonomy enabled on-highway truck platform offering.Learn more at Volvo Autonomous SolutionsInfolist ItemsPausePlay% buffered00:00 Building safer roads for all driversSafely.
